This paper attempts explore the phenomenon of dehumanisation of patients in medical and care recipient settings. Rather than attributing blame to individuals this paper tries to 

\section{Definition of identified issue} %400

\textcite{haslam_recent_2016} defines dehumanisation as the act of perceiving or treating people as if they are less that fully human and \textcite{haque_dehumanization_2012} states that the essence of dehumanisation is the denial of distinctively human mind to another person they, further emphasise that the process of dehumanisation denies the victims mind the dimensions of \textit{experience} or \textit{agency} and sometime both. \textit{Experience} being the capacity to feel pleasure and pain and \textit{agency} being the ability to plan, intend and exert choice.
The issue that has been identified is dehumanisation of patients in medical and care receiving setting.The core of the question being asked is would these individuals (patients) be treated the same way had they not been a patients at the hospital.
% reflection
\\
On a tour of Port Arthur historic sites, the tour guide showed us a a fairly intact building where the colonial government kept their worst of the worst criminal's, a place where convicts were stripped of their identity as an individual and imposed a number, by which he will be hence addressed by. A punishment so atrocious to the human nature that it inspired callous hearts to repent and transcend the pain of whip lashes. what this reminded me of was how we as nurses may be guilty of similar lapses when we talk about our patients as room numbers or when some people sometimes somehow seem to not see patients as people but as a personified object.

 The search strategy used to identify relevant literature for this paper involved searching the Scopus electronic journal database and google scholar database. Keywords such as "dehumanisation of patient","patients","dehumanisation","dehumanization" where used. The results where primarily sorted by relevance and  the number of citations. Primary research were then identified and six relevant from that were selected based on research question and setting. The selected papers were ran against a retraction watch database to see if there where any retractions.

\section{Overview of literature supporting issue} %600

%Patients are not fully human: a nurse's coping response to stress
\textcite{trifiletti_patients_2014} Conducted a questionnaire based anonymous survey with the voluntary participation of one hundred and nine nurses working in a central Italian town hospital.
The researchers delivered 220 survey packages which included the questionnaire, A letter explaining the aims of research guaranteeing anonymity. 109 of the 220 questionnaires were returned and were used for this study. The questions asked were mainly focused to determine the co-relation between dehumanisation of patients and stress experienced by staff. The researchers used multiple variables such as humaneness attribution, commitment to organisation, commitment to patient and stress. The research found that there is a strong co-relation between a nurses commitment to patients and the nurses stress levels and conversely nurses who showed higher commitment to organisation had lower stress levels, they also found that more the nurse attributes uniquely human characteristics to a patient higher the stress levels. From this observation the researchers hypothesised that viewing patients as less than human makes their sufferings more bearable and protects nurses from stress. 
A major limitation of this study is the statistical principle that co-relation does not imply causation \cite{altman_association_2015}. Due to this the research
